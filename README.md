# thalamo-cortical-calcium-analysis

Code to process two-photon calcium imaging and pupil tracking data from recordings of thalamic boutons and cortical dendrites (GCaMP6f) in layer 1 of the posterior parietal cortex of mice. Recordings were done during a tactile-based Go/NoGo paradigm.

Behavioral data acquisition was used using a custom Python/Arduino-based system defined at [https://github.com/palmerlab/behaviour_box](https://github.com/palmerlab/behaviour_box), and two-photon calcium imaging was acquired using software provided for Thorlabs Bergamo Bscope  (Thorimage LS 2.4).
